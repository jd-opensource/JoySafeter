"""LanceDB business persistence layer.

Sits on top of :mod:`everos.core.persistence.lancedb` (connection
factory + ``BaseLanceTable`` + ``LanceRepoBase``) and provides:

    * lazy process-wide connection + per-name table cache
      (:mod:`.lancedb_manager`)
    * concrete schemas under :mod:`.tables`
    * concrete repository singletons under :mod:`.repos`

External usage::

    from app.everos.infra.persistence.lancedb import (
        get_connection, get_table, dispose_connection,
        Episode, AtomicFact, Foresight, AgentCase, AgentSkill, UserProfile,
        KnowledgeTopic,
        episode_repo, atomic_fact_repo, foresight_repo,
        agent_case_repo, agent_skill_repo, user_profile_repo,
        knowledge_topic_repo,
    )

Three index kinds: scalar / BM25 / vector. Tables are created lazily on
first access; row population is the cascade daemon's job (see
``12_cascade_design.md``).
