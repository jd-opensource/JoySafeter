"""AgentSkill frontmatter — single SKILL.md inside a skill directory.

Path: ``agents/<scope_id>/skills/skill_<name>/SKILL.md`` (plus sibling
``references/*.md`` and ``scripts/*.<ext>`` files that are not part of
the frontmatter contract).

Skills are *named entities* rather than daily-log entries: the
LanceDB primary key is ``<owner_id>_<skill_name>`` (no date / seq).
Upserts replace the file wholesale; the cascade daemon recomputes the
``content`` index column by concatenating ``SKILL.md`` body with every
``references/*.md`` sibling.

Five directory-shape ClassVars pin the layout in one place so the
writer / reader pair reads off them — no duplicated string literals.
