"""Cascade worker — consumes pending rows and runs the matching handler.

The worker is the only piece that crosses the md → LanceDB boundary.
Each cycle:

1. ``claim_pending_batch(BATCH_SIZE)`` atomically flips pending rows to
   ``processing`` and returns them in LSN order.
2. For each row, look up the kind's :class:`Handler` and call either
   :meth:`handle_added_or_modified` or :meth:`handle_deleted` based on
   the row's ``change_type``.
3. On success: ``mark_done``.
4. On :class:`RecoverableError`: retry inline up to ``MAX_RETRY``; if
   all attempts fail, ``mark_failed(retryable=True)``.
5. On any other exception: ``mark_failed(retryable=False)`` (treated
   as unrecoverable, surfaces in ``cascade fix`` for the user to
   triage by editing the md).

Batch processing is concurrent inside a batch (``asyncio.gather``);
ordering across rows is best-effort — the LSN gives a deterministic
prefix but the handlers themselves are independent.

After a batch completes, each kind that mutated its LanceDB table is
passed to :meth:`_schedule_optimize` — a per-kind throttle + trailing
edge scheduler that fires LanceDB ``optimize()`` as a separate task,
so the drain loop is never blocked by index maintenance. A 60-second
heartbeat sweeps every kind through the same gate so unindexed
fragments don't linger after a worker restart even without new
writes. See :meth:`_schedule_optimize` for the exact semantics.

A separate 12-hour loop (:meth:`_rebuild_loop`) does a full
``drop_index + create_index`` per kind to bound the **active** index
UUID / FTS segment count growth — a workaround for an upstream gap
in the lancedb Python async API; see
:meth:`everos.core.persistence.lancedb.LanceRepoBase.rebuild_indexes`
for the full provenance and the conditions under which this scheduler
can be removed.

This is the **only** application-level mechanism we have to bound the
active index UUID / segment count growth — see
:meth:`LanceRepoBase.rebuild_indexes` for the full provenance: Rust
``OptimizeOptions.num_indices_to_merge`` is the right knob but
``lancedb.AsyncTable.optimize()`` does not expose it (verified on
lancedb main 2026-05-28), and on the embedded ``lance crate 4.0`` the
merge behaviour itself is broken so even calling Lance directly
wouldn't help.

12 hours is a conservative pick: rebuild cost is ~0.3s per 50k rows
× indexed columns (measured locally), so even a small EverOS
deployment can absorb it without scheduling around peaks. Smaller
intervals work fine functionally; we just don't need them — under
realistic single-user / small-team write rates 12h keeps active UUIDs
bounded well below any FD ceiling. Tune via the constructor argument.

**Remove this scheduler** once lancedb exposes ``num_indices_to_merge``
on the async Python API and the embedded lance crate ships the
working merge implementation; ``optimize(num_indices_to_merge=1)``
in the regular hot path will do the same job for ~free.

"""How often (per kind) to add ``cleanup_older_than`` to ``optimize()``.

``optimize()`` without ``cleanup_older_than`` compacts fragments and
merges new data into indexes, but **leaves stale physical files on disk
forever** (replaced data fragments, historical manifests, stale index
UUID files). On a lightweight (single-user / small-team) deployment
with steady-state cascade ingest, that file count grows without bound
and eventually
exhausts file descriptors at index-scan time (observed: macOS / Linux
default ``ulimit -n`` of 1024 — the ``os error 24`` reported in CI).

The prune itself is cheap when scoped to recent versions; we just don't
want to pay it on every 1-second throttle tick. 5 minutes is the
shortest interval that comfortably outlives any in-flight query / index
build, while keeping the on-disk footprint bounded. It is also passed
as ``cleanup_older_than`` itself (semantically: "the retention window
equals the prune cadence") — every file replaced more than one cadence
ago becomes eligible.

Does **not** shrink active index internals (FTS ``part_N`` count or
vector index UUID count): those only collapse via ``drop_index +
create_index``, which is intentionally out of scope here.

        accumulation from a previous session. Subsequent sweeps honour
